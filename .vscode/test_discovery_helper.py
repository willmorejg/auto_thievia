# Configuration for Python tools and testing

# This file helps VS Code and other tools find our Python configuration
# The actual configuration is in pyproject.toml and .vscode/settings.json

# Test discovery should work with:
# - pytest tests/
# - Python Test Discovery in VS Code (should auto-detect)
# - Test Explorer in the sidebar

# To manually refresh test discovery in VS Code:
# 1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
# 2. Run "Python: Refresh Tests"
# 3. Or "Test: Reset and Reload All Test Data"

# If tests don't appear:
# 1. Check Python interpreter is set to .venv/bin/python
# 2. Ensure pytest is enabled in settings
# 3. Try restarting VS Code

print("Python project configured for testing with pytest")
